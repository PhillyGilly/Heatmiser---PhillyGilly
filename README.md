Heatmiser Neo-Hub / Neostat / Neostat-e support for home-assistant.io

This is a work in progress for adding Heatmiser Neo-hub support to Home Assistant (https://home-assistant.io/), I maintain this as a weekend project only so don't expect fast updates but feel free to raise issues as needed.

Installation:

Before starting installation you should know the IP address of the Neo-hub. If you don't know the IP address, use one of the approaches suggested below to find your neo-hub's IP address.

It is suggested that you should allocate a static IP to the Heatmiser Neo-hub or use a DNS entry that's resolvable by Home-Assistant.

The preferred method of installation is to use the Home Assistant function which you access via Configuration->Integrations.
Clicking on the orange icon in the bottom right corner produces a drop down list and scroll down to "Heatmiser Neo Climate".

When the integration starts you will need to enter the Neo-hub IP address. The port is always 4242.

When the integration is running you can still change logger options by editing (usually) configuration.yaml as described below.

If you are using this method of installation in an instance of Home Assistant which had an earlier manual installation, you will need to remove the entry in yur configuration.yaml file


Legacy installation:

You can also install manually if you are running a version of HA that doesn't offer Integrations as below.
Install and configure SSH server from the "Add-on store". Once you have shell run the following:
```
cd /config/
mkdir custom_components
cd /config/custom_components
git clone https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant
mv Heatmiser-for-home-assistant heatmiserneo
```

For Manual / Custom installations:
Change directory to config location then run the following:
```
mkdir custom_components
cd /config/custom_components
git clone https://github.com/MindrustUK/Heatmiser-for-home-assistant
mv Heatmiser-for-home-assistant heatmiserneo
```
For both above scenarios then complete configuration by adding the following to the configuration.yaml in your /config directory.

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: heatmiserneo
    host: <Insert IP Address / Hostname>
    port: 4242
```


Find your Neo-hub's IP address:

[Authors note: Add notes about how to find your heatmiser neohub on your network (Nmap, checking your routers DHCP table, ARP etc).]

Suggestions from Haakon Storm Heen, Use namp on your local network range:

```nmap -Pn -p4242 -oG - 192.168.1.0/24 | grep 4242 | grep -i open```


(Optional) Logging Configuration:

If debugging is required (submitting bug reports etc.) logger verbosity can be adjusted as follows:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.heatmiserneo: debug
```
